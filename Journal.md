- **Wednesday 07th April:**: Extract faces that are detected and save them for few shot learning purposes. **Problems: ** Not able to perform it when more than one face is present in the scene. Problems with color channels.
- **Thursday 08th April:** Problem with color channels has been solved. Several faces can be extracted now. **Problems:** Wrong labelling of the faces given the lack of tracking. Tracking is further introduced. 
- **Friday 09th April:** Tracking is introduced. **Problems:** Only one bounding box is drawn although several trackers (one per each individual) is defined
- **Monday 12th April: ** Solving tracking problems. Still not perfectly done since bounding boxes are tracking the objects, yet identification per each user is not happening.
